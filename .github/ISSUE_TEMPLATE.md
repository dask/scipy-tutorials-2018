To start conversation we might consider the following questions:

1.  What sorts of applications might make for a good parallel computing
    exercise within this domain?

2.  If these applications are data-intensive then are there publicly
    available datasets that are inconveniently large?

3.  What software requirements are likely to be necessary to run these
    computations?

4.  What challenges should we expect when parallelizing these algorithms or
    accessing this data at scale?

Of course feel free to disregard these questions and engage in more direct
conversation.
